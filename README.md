MVP
Find and integrate soccer team api 
Render team api data to the page inside of my dropdown
Layout my information using html and js
Style the page with flexbox tools and css
add media queries to help make design more responsive for mobile app


Timeframes
The most time I spent was on the array of teams that would be up against each other which is the first code below. The next problem that took up time was getting the api information accessable to get the image. The code in number 2 allowed me to do that. 
1.
const newTeam = (team) => {

    let userSelect = document.getElementById('select').value;
    document.getElementById('matchup').innerHTML =" you have chosen " + userSelect;  
    // const newTeam = matchTeams.push(userSelect);
    
    
    console.log(matchTeams);
    matchTeams.push(userSelect);
    //document.querySelector('.games').append(matchTeams);
    // matchTeams = [];
    teamOne = matchTeams[0];
    teamTwo = matchTeams[1];
    document.getElementById('teams').innerHTML = teamOne+ " vs " + teamTwo;
    return teamOne, teamTwo;
}
2.part1
    .then((resJSON) => {
        console.log(resJSON);
        showTeamData(resJSON);
        resJSON.data.forEach((team) => {teamList.push(team)})
        

        })
2.part2
if(matchTeams.length ===1){
    const logo = document.createElement('img')

    const choice = teamList.find(item => teamOne === item.name) 
    console.log(choice)
    logo.src=choice.logo;
    
    document.querySelector('#teamImg').appendChild(logo)
}
    
    const logo2 = document.createElement('img')
    
    const choice2 = teamList.find(item => teamTwo === item.name) 
    console.log(choice2)
    logo2.src=choice2.logo;

    document.querySelector('#teamImg').appendChild(logo2)





Change Log
I ended up changing a lot. I planned on having the team images show up when selected and also wanted to make a tournament out of the teams selected. I had trouble pulling out the image of the selection made which changed how I wanted to the tournament. Also before that I planned on having the user to build out a starting 11 of players, but I could not get an api that would allow me to have the data to do that.
